## Restful Fire

ARESTful API / REST API is an implementation of the API (Application Programming Interface). 

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural method of communication that uses the HTTP protocol for data exchange and this method is often applied in application development. Where the goal is to make a system that has good performance, is fast and easy to scale, especially in data exchange and communication.

## RESTFUL API has 4 important components in it which are

1. URL Design

RESTful APIs are accessed using the HTTP protocol. Consistent naming and URL structure will result in a good API that is easy for developers to understand. An API URL is usually called an endpoint in its call.

2. HTTP Verbs

Every request made there is a method used so that the server understands what is being requested by the client

- GET
GET is the simplest HTTP Request method, this method is used to read or get data from the source.
- POST
POST is an HTTP Request method that is used to create new data by inserting data in the body when the request is made.
- PUT
PUT is an HTTP Request method that is usually used to update resource data.
- DELETE
DELETE is an HTTP Request method that is used to delete data from a resource.

3. HTTP Response Code

HTTP response code is a standardized code in informing the results of the request to the client. 

In general, there are 3 groups that we usually encounter in RESTful APIs, namely:

- 2XX : is the response code that shows that the request was successful.
- 4XX : is a response code that shows that the request has encountered an error on the client side.
- 5XX : is the response code that shows that the request has encountered an error on the server side.

4. Response Format

Every request made by the client will receive response data from the server, the response is usually in the form of XML or JSON data. After getting the response data, the client can use it by parsing the data and processing it as needed.

## Laravel

Laravel changes website development to be more elegant, expressive, and fun, according to its jargon “The PHP Framework For Web Artisans”. In addition, Laravel also simplifies the website development process with the help of several excellent features, such as Template Engine, Routing, and Modularity.

Laravel offers several advantages when you develop a website using the basis of this framework :

1. the website becomes more scalable (easy to develop).
2. there are namespaces and views that help you to organize and manage website resources.
3. the development process becomes faster so it saves time because Laravel can be combined with several components from other frameworks to develop websites.

## Postman

Postman is a computer application used for API testing. Postman sends an API request to the web server and receives a response, whatever it is. No additional work or framework setup is required when sending and receiving requests in Postman. Widely used by Testers and Developers for better testing of apps. Easily integrates with your Continuous Integration (CI) & Continuous Development Pipeline.
