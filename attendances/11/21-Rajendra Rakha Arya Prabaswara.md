In Weeks 11 is the division of large task groups

In this week I learned about :

1. How to design a good UI/UX,

3. Database 
4. Firebase 

## Sql Lite Database 

SQLite is a serverless and standalone database. With Sql Lite we can save data and learn about CRUD (Create,Reset,Update,Delete ) Data.

## FIrebase

Firebase is a service from Google that is used to make it easier for application developers to develop applications. With Firebase, app developers can focus on developing apps without having to put in a lot of effort. Two interesting features of Firebase are Firebase Remote Config and Firebase Realtime Database. In addition, there are supporting features for applications that require notifications, namely Firebase Notification.

1. Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication is an authentication system service that implements a client-side code, so that users can register and login to Google applications.

Additionally, Firebase includes a user management system where developers can enable user authentication with email logins and passwords stored with Firebase.

Firebase Authentication supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular unified identity providers, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and more.

## Additional 

- **Future** is a "data type" that is called with a delay or "delay". No
Like any other method, the system will continue to execute that method until that method
done walking

- **async** : uses future on a method, thus making the system wait until blocking occurs. Therefore, the method must be marked with async.

- **await** : If any method is marked await, it means that the system must wait until The syntax is finished.
