Flutter is different from other frameworks because its UI is built in code, not (for example) in an XML file or similar. Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter UI. As you progress through this codelab, you’ll learn that almost everything in Flutter is a widget. A widget is an immutable object that describes a specific part of a UI. You’ll also learn that Flutter widgets are composable, meaning that you can combine existing widgets to make more sophisticated widgets. At the end of this codelab, you’ll get to apply what you’ve learned into building a Flutter UI that displays a business card. Row and Column classes Row and Column are classes that contain and lay out widgets. Widgets inside of a Row or Column are called children, and Row and Column are referred to as parents. Row lays out its widgets horizontally, and Column lays out its widgets vertically. Nama Omar Abdul Raoof Taha Ghaleb Al-Maktary NIM: 1941720237
