Flutter is different because it only has a thin layer of C/C++ code. Flutter implements most of its system (compositing, gestures, animation, framework, widgets, etc) in Dart 
(a modern, concise, object-oriented language) that developers can easily approach read, change, replace, or remove. This gives developers tremendous control over the system, 
as well as significantly lowers the bar to approachability for the majority of the system.
Flutter is different than most other options for building mobile apps because it doesn’t rely on web browser technology nor the set of widgets that ship with each device. 
Instead, Flutter uses its own high-performance rendering engine to draw widgets.
Row, Column widgets let you create flexible layouts in both the horizontal (Row) and vertical (Column) directions. The design of these objects is based on the web’s flexbox 
layout model.
