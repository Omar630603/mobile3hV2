Laravel
Laravel changes website development to be more elegant, expressive, and fun, according to its jargon “The PHP Framework For Web Artisans”. In addition, Laravel also simplifies the website development process with the help of several excellent features, such as Template Engine, Routing, and Modularity.

Laravel offers several advantages when you develop a website using the basis of this framework.

First, the website becomes more scalable (easy to develop).
Second, there are namespaces and views that help you to organize and manage website resources.
Third, the development process becomes faster so it saves time because Laravel can be combined with several components from other frameworks to develop websites.
Postman
In simple words, Postman is a computer application used for API testing. Postman sends an API request to the web server and receives a response, whatever it is. No additional work or framework setup is required when sending and receiving requests in Postman. Widely used by Testers and Developers for better testing of apps. Easily integrates with your Continuous Integration (CI) & Continuous Development Pipeline.

FIRE
API or Application Programming Interface is an interface that can connect one application with another application. So, the API acts as an intermediary between different applications, either within the same platform or across platforms.

Authentication
Laravel sanctum provides featherweight authentication system for Single Page Application (SPA), mobile application and simple token based API. Sanctum allows each app user to generate multiple API tokens for their account. These tokens can be assigned capabilities or scopes that determine which actions the token is allowed to perform.
