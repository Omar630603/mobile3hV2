## WakaTime Installation

Wakatime itself is an application that will automatically capture time, the type of programming languages, and what operating system will be displayed on the dashboard. 

That way, I can know how many hours I've been coding, how many times I've committed, and what projects I've been working on.

## Application with statefull widget

To make this application, start by making
a design that can be started by creating a wireframe or a full design on the device
software like adobe xd or sketch and others

## Stateless Widget

Stateless widget is static / final where the value or configuration has been initialized from the start, the variable value in this widget cannot be changed by this widget itself
but it can be changed by the parent widget if the parent is StatefullWidget

## Stateful Widget

Stateful widgets are dynamic, these widgets can be updated when needed accordingly
with user actions or if there is any data change. Data changes on statefull
widgets are triggered by state changes therefore a StatefullWidget always has a State

## Send Parameters to child

A widget can pass parameters to its child widget via its constructor
owned by the widget this parameter can adjust to the needs that
owned by the widgets.
